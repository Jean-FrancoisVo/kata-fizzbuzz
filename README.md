# The Infamous Fizz Buzz kata and its different flavour

## TLDR
 * A number is fizz if it is divisible by 3 
 * A number is buzz if it is divisible by 5
 * A number is fizzbuzz if it is divisible by 3 and 5

## Roll the introduction
I'll explore, dissect and try the different way I can resolve this kata.

The rule is simple : 

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.

## Ways
1. TDD, KISS, Baby steps, Parameterized tests, Property based testing
